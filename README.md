# Workshop: occupancy models in R

A workshop on occupancy models in R. This workshop uses the 'unmarked' package to construct single season occupancy models in R. All examples use a simulated dataset.

This workshop covers:

* single season occupancy models and goodness-of-fit tests

Contents:

* 01_installingoccupancypackages.R checks if required packages are installled. Installs them if they are not.
* 02_singleseasonoccupancy.R contains code for introduction to occupancy models
* detection_history.csv contains simulated detection history data
* site_cov.csv contains simulated site covariates (forest cover and agriculture cover)
* effort.csv contains simulated observation covariate for search effort per survey
* observers.csv contains simulated observation covariate for number of observers per survey
